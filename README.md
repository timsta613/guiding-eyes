## Installation Instructions
The following instructions are used to install packages and libraries needed for this project. Steps 1-4 follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/RaspberryPi3.md) with notes on things to avoid or be aware of
### 1. Install Ubuntu MATE on your Raspberry Pi 3

> **Note:** Ubuntu MATE on Raspberry Pi may present a `Kernel not started` error on startup. This can be ignored as it doesn't affect functionality<br/>

Download the file from the Ubuntu Mate website
For Windows, use Win32 Disk Imager or a similar disk imager to write the file to your sd card
Boot the pi up connected to a hdmi monitor and complete setup/system configuration


### 2. Clone and compile Intel Realsense SDK
> **Note:** Camera capabilities are severely reduced when connected to USB2 port due to lack of bandwidth. <br /> However, this should not be a problem with this project as firmware updates have added more functionality. 

> **Note:** Make sure the camera's firmware is up-to-date <br/>



### 3. Activate the OpenGL driver
Activate [OpenGL](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/tutorial-activate-opengl-driver-for-ubuntu-mate-16-04/7094/33)

`sudo raspi-config` 
Then in Advanced options -> Activate opengl driver
`sudo reboot`
### 4. Install wiringPi
Install [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/)
### 5. Install OpenCV 
Install [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/opencv_tutorials.pdf)
### 6. Setting up Pi to run on startup
[Run on boot](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/)
## Usage

### 1. Detect objects within walking path

### 2. Build a dataset

### 3. Test algorithms
